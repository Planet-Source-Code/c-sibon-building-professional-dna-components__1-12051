## Building Professional DNA Components


</div>

### Description

Building Professional ActiveX Components (DLL) for Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174; Distributed interNet Applications Architecture (Windows DNA), in this example you maybe understand the use of DataAccess Components and Bussiness Logic Components, my components are compatible with almost every task and programming language: VC++, VB Frontend or ASP/Pearl), I buit this components for an ONLINE (WWW) CD Shop, like CDNow. Written for SQL Server 7.0 and 2000. If you can, write this in VC++ with 100% SQL without the ADO (Performance) Like I do for my work. Hoh Yeah... Long Live THE QUEEN OF HOLLAND. Enjoy. P.S: You NEED the GuiGen.DLL for the ID's, those are 38 long Unique Identifiers, I can't ADD that DLL because you need to pay for it... I'm sorry, but you may replace it with some other (less effective maybe).. Good Luck.
